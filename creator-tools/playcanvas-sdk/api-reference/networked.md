### Transform

By adding the Transform component, an entity's position and rotation will be networked across clients.

{% hint style="warning" %}
At this time, Transform does not network the Scale property of the entity.
{% endhint %}

### Anim

By adding the Anim component, an entity's animation state will be networked across clients.
